# PitchPerfect

Using this app, you can record an audio and add some distortions to it.
I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development.

I learned how to:

- Use Storyboards and AutoLayout 
- Connect multiple views
- Design views using StackView
- Use AVFoundation methods
- Record audio using AVAudioRecorder
- Add audio effects using AVAudioEngine

This app was made using the course "Intro to iOS App Development with Swift" from Udacity.
