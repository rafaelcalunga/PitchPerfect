# PitchPerfect

This app was made using the  course "Intro to iOS App Development with Swift" from Udacity.
Using this app, you can record an audio and add some distortions to it.

I learned how to:

- Use Storyboards and AutoLayout 
- Connect multiple views
- Design views using StackView
- Use AVFoundation methods

- Add audio effects using AVAudioEngine
